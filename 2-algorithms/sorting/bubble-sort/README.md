Bubble sort

- The bubble sort is one of the slowest sorting algorithms, but it is also one of the easiest sorts to implement.

- Bubble sort requires n - 1 pass to sort an array of n elements

- in each pass we have n - k  comparisons, when n is the number of elements and k is the pass number.

- The bubble sort gets its name because when data are sorted using the algorithm, values
float like a bubble from one end of the array to the other. Assuming you are sorting a
set of numbers into ascending order, larger values float to the right of the array and
lower values float to the left. This behavior is the result of the algorithm moving through the array many times, comparing adjacent values, and swapping them if the value to the left is greater than the value to the right.
