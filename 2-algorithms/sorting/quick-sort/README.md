Quicksort

- The Quicksort algorithm is one of the fastest sorting algorithms for large data sets.

- Quicksort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that recursively breaks a list of data into successively smaller sublists consisting of the smaller elements and the larger elements.

- The algorithm continues this process until all the data in the list is sorted.

- The algorithm divides the list into sublists by selecting one element of the list as a pivot.

- Data is sorted around the pivot by moving elements less than the pivot to the bottom
of the list and elements that are greater than the pivot to the top of the list.

- The Quicksort algorithm is best to use on large data sets; its performance degrades for smaller data sets.
