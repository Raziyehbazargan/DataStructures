**Selection sort**

- This sort works by starting at the beginning of the array and comparing the first element with the remaining elements.

- Selection sort requires n - 1 pass to sort an array of n elements.

- in each pass we have n - k  comparisons, when n is the number of elements and k is the pass number.

- After examining all the elements, the smallest element is placed in the first position
of the array, and the algorithm moves to the second position. This process continues
until the algorithm arrives at the next to last position in the array, at which point
all the data is sorted.
