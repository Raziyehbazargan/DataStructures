Divide and Conquer:

is an algorithmic paradigm. A typical Divide and Conquer algorithm solves a problem using following three steps.

1. Divide: Break the given problem into subproblems of same type.
2. Conquer: Recursively solve these subproblems
3. Combine: Appropriately combine the answers

Following are some standard algorithms that are Divide and Conquer algorithms.

1- Binary Search
2- Quick Sort
3- Merge Sort

Following are some standard algorithms that are Divide and Conquer algorithms.

1- Merge Sort:
	- worst case running time:  O(nlogn)
	- space complexity

2- Quick Sort: 
	- worst case running time:  O(nlogn)
	- space complexity
