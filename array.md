## Array: (FIFO : FIRST IN - FIRST OUT)

- Arrays are a fundamental data structure, and they are extremely useful!
- We use arrays to hold values of the same type at contiguous memory locations.
- One way to analogize the notion af array is to think of your local post office, which usually has a large bank of post office boxes.

- The elements of an array indexed starting from 0 and the last element is (array.length-1).
